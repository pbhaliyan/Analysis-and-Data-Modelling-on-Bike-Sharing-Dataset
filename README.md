# Analysis-and-Data-Modelling-on-Bike-Sharing-Dataset
This python notebook is about exploring, analysing,and modelling bike sharing dataset which has been extracted from Kaggle. Following are the steps being performed: 
* Creating training, validation, and test dataset -Using defined **Dataloader** method
* Pre- Processing the data
     Treating missing values
     Outlier detection - Box Plot
     Removing outliers
     Correlation matrix
* Selecting the best modelling method
* Training the model and calculatint its score
* Feature importance
