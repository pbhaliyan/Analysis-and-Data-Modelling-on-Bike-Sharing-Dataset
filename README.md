# Analysis-and-Data-Modelling-on-Bike-Sharing-Dataset
#### This python notebook is about exploring, analysing,and modelling bike sharing dataset which has been extracted from Kaggle. Following are the steps being performed: ####
1. Creating training, validation, and test dataset -Using defined **Dataloader** method
2.  Pre- Processing the data
     * Treating missing values
     * Outlier detection - **Using Box Plot visualization**
     * Removing outliers- **Using IQR(Inter-Quartile range) method**
     * Correlation Analysis for dimensionality reduction
3.  Selecting the best modelling method
4.  Training the model and calculating the score
5.  Feature importance and plotting important features- **Bar Graph**

 ### Libraries imported ###
 1. **PrettyTable** - To display the output in tabular format
 2. **Seaborn and Matplotlib** - For plotting and visualization
 3. **Pandas and Numpy** - For data structure and analysis
 4. **Sklearn** - For Predictive Data Analytics
